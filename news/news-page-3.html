                    <p>Day three of Book Week was a whirlwind of events 🧚‍♀️ Were you able to keep up? If you happened
                        to miss anything, worry not, here's our recap of today's big events:</p>
                    <p>We kicked off with the bustling Parade of Pages: Book Character Walk. Worlds collide on FEU
                        Diliman's grounds as our participants brought to life their favorite characters. We spotted Greg
                        Heffley from Diary of a Wimpy Kid, a Stormtrooper from Star Wars, The Boy Who Lived himself,
                        Harry Potter along with the brightest witch, Hermionie Granger and even the dynamic duo of Peter
                        Pan and Tinkerbell (don't think we missed where Waldo was either!) Our charming participants
                        took to the stage in character and led us through each and every one of their enthralling
                        stories. </p>
                    <p>To infinity and beyond! Book Week Blast-Off: Opening Ceremony pulled no stops, hosted by The
                        Inscriptors' illustrious President, Elijah James Banabana and the HUMSS Organization's very own
                        External Vice President, Neyarah Sheyn Soriano. Our lively hosts kept the energy up and going to
                        the satisfaction of today's gleeful participants. Every good book captures its audience with a
                        striking opener and we have these two to thank for keeping the ball rolling. </p>
                    <p>"When you're going to change the world, don't ask for permission." That's just the attitude our
                        students in attendance took for the Symposium: "AI in Academic Research: Tools for Student
                        Success". Seniors and College students came together for a shared learning experience in the
                        Main Building's Audio Visual Room. Our esteemed speaker Assistant Professor Dan Anthony Dorado,
                        a full-time faculty at the U.P. School of Library and Information Studies, generously imparted
                        his extensive knowledge in Data Science for the benefit of FEU Diliman's students who aim for
                        progress in the fast-paced digital era. We express our gratitude to you, sir, for empowering our
                        students with invaluable information that will undoubtedly serve them well moving forward. </p>
                    <p>After a deep dive into AI, let's bring it back to the basics. Ikuzo, aspiring mangaka! Students
                        looking to increase their art proficiency held their pencils and papers with purpose during the
                        Manga Masterclass: Learn to Draw Manga. Participants were provided worksheets during the event
                        to try out new techniques introduced. That's one more step into realizing the stories they hold
                        with their desired level of technical skill. We look forward to the extraordinary experiences
                        these budding artists will create. Perhaps something as splendid as Hayao Miyazaki's portrayal
                        of the natural world, cherishing the details of reality within fiction.</p>
                    <p>Next is a battle of wits! The Battle of The Readers brought a competitive spark to the Book Week
                        festivities, as teams of Junior High School students went head-to-head, answering questions that
                        spanned the realms of literature. These young literary enthusiasts showcased not only their
                        intellect but also their passion for reading. The atmosphere was charged with excitement as
                        every correct answer was met with cheers, and every tough question challenged our participants
                        to think on their feet. Congratulations to all the teams who participated and demonstrated
                        exceptional mastery of the literary world. Your hard work and preparation truly paid off!</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, in the realm of strategy, the Junior High School </p>
                    <p>Checkmate Challenge: Chess Tournament proved to be an intense mental showdown. Our brilliant
                        young chess masters locked eyes with their opponents, carefully plotting each move with
                        precision. The chessboard became a battleground for creativity, patience, and cunning as pawns
                        were advanced and kings were checkmated. A round of applause for all our FEUture Tamaraw Chess
                        Grandmasters!</p>
                    <p>The denouement may have approached and a satisfying end to this year's Book Week may have already
                        came. Goodbyes have been said but not just yet, we have more memories to share before our paths
                        diverge and wander off into the unknown once more. Get ready for tomorrow's recap for the final
                        wave of events!</p>
